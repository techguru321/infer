(** Interprocedural Analysis *)

(** Analyze [proc_name] and return the updated summary. Use module
{!Timeout } to call {!perform_analysis_phase } with a time limit, and
then return the updated summary. Executed as a child process. *)
val analyze_proc : Exe_env.t -> Procname.t -> Specs.summary

(** Process the result of the analysis of [proc_name]: update the
returned summary and add it to the spec table. Executed in the
parent process as soon as a child process returns a result. *)
val process_result : Exe_env.t -> (Procname.t * Cg.in_out_calls) -> Specs.summary -> unit

(** Return true if the analysis of [proc_name] should be
skipped. Called by the parent process before attempting to analyze a
proc. *)
