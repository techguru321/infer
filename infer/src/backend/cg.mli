type t (** the type of a call graph *)

(** A call graph consists of a set of nodes (Procname.t), and edges between them.
A node can be defined or undefined (to represent whether we have code for it).
In an edge from [n1] to [n2], indicating that [n1] calls [n2], [n1] is the parent and [n2] is the child.
Node [n1] is dependent on [n2] if there is a path from [n1] to [n2] using the child relationship. *)

(** [add_edge cg f t] adds an edge from [f] to [t] in the call graph [cg]. The nodes are also added as undefined, unless already present. *)
