# Back End

The back end is responsible for the analysis of a project starting from an intermediate representation stored in the results directory, typically `infer-out`.

The main entry point is module [InferAnalyze](InferAnalyze.re).

Module [InferPrint](InferPrint.re) is used to export the analysis results.
