;; Do not let jbuilder generate .merlin files because it gets it
;; wrong. This is mainly due to the fact that source files live in
;; sub-directories and are copied into _build/ by our jbuild. jbuilder
;; wants to write "S ." in .merlin but that makes merlin use the
;; copied source files in _build/ instead of only using the original
;; files.
;;
;; The generated .merlin also doesn't know about the ppx used. This is
;; because some of our source files use some ppx and others do not, and
;; since jbuilder is trying to find a configuration that works for all the
;; files it only keeps the pxx common to all files.
