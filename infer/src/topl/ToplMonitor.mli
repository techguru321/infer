val generate : ToplAutomaton.t -> Procname.t -> Procdesc.t option
(** [generate automaton proc_name] returns a CFG, provided that [proc_name] is a recognized
    procedure name *)

val sourcefile : unit -> SourceFile.t
(** For debug. *)

val cfg : unit -> Cfg.t
(** For debug. This datastructure accumulates all the procedures that were synthesized by the
    current process. If the implementation is correct, then different processes synthesize the same
    procedures, given the same set of Topl properties. However, for debug, we print the
    datastructure in a filename that contains the PID, which is why [sourcefile] is exposed. *)
