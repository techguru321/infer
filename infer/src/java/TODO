- Sawja being GPL, remember to produce two binaries, one with Infer and one for the Sawja libs, for the releases versions

- In the construction of cfgs: add line numbers for the start and the exit nodes

- Sil.typename should rather be called namedType to clarify that it is not the name of a type, but a type build with a name

- If sil.mli, the different kinds of if are not documented. Some are clear but others are obscure. The choice of an if_kind should also be explained

- translate correctly the JBir.ArrayLength expression

- in sil.mli, the explanation of what the function expand_type does is not clear enough

- take into account the final keyword

- rename the file InferInject.ml into inferinject.ml as it not consistent with the other module names.
