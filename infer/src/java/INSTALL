This file contains the instructions to compile a version of Infer to verify
Java programs.

In order to avoid problems with some dependencies that may occur at compile time,
it is best to use the OCaml Batteries Included distribution.

Step 1) Install Javalib and Sawja with the following the instruction:

a) install libzip-dev:

	On ubuntu, install: libzip-ocaml-dev

b) first install javalib by going to:

  	 dependencies/javalib-2.2.2

  and run
    ./configure.sh

  and follow the instructions. 

c) install Sawja:

  go to

	dependencies/sawja-1.4

  and then:

	./configure.sh
  	 make && sudo make install

Step 2) InferJava can now be compiled by going to the directory:
	
	infer/java

 and typing:

	make

This will automatically compile the InferJava binary and move it to

	infer/bin

Note that folder with the binary should be added to PATH
