  A hierarchical ordering of a set is a well-parenthesized permutation of its elements without two
  consecutive "(". I defines a total order <= over its elements.
  The elements between two matching parentheses are called a Component.
  The first element of a Component is called the head.
  Let denote by H(v) the set of head of the nested components containing v.

module Partition : sig
  type 'node t = private
    | Empty
    | Node of {node: 'node; next: 'node t}
    | Component of {head: 'node; rest: 'node t; next: 'node t}

  val pp : pp_node:(F.formatter -> 'node -> unit) -> F.formatter -> 'node t -> unit

  A weak topological ordering (WTO) of a directed graph is a hierarchical ordering of its vertices
  such that for every edge u -> v,
    u < v  and  v is not in H(u)    (forward edge)
  or
    v <= u  and  v is in H(u)       (feedback edge)

  A WTO of a directed graph is such that the head u of every feedback edge u -> v is the head of a
  component containing its tail v.
