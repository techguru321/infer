# Checkers

Checkers is an infrastructure to facitilate writing lightweight checks starting from the Intermediate Representation [IR](../IR/README.md) of a project.

Module [Checkers](checkers.mli) contains a number of sample checkers.

Individual checkers can be activated using module [RegisterCheckers](registercheckers.ml).
