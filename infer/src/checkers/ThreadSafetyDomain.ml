(** A bool that is true if a lock is definitely held. Note that this is unsound because it assumes
    the existence of one global lock. In the case that a lock is held on the access to a variable,
    but the lock held is the wrong one, we will erroneously say that the access is thread-safe.
    However, this coarse abstraction saves us from the complexity of tracking which locks are held
    and which memory locations correspond to the same lock. *)
