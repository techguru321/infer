This directory aims to demonstrate that the analysis of Java files
uses the summaries from doli-defined functions.

In prticular, the call

 ~/infer/infer/bin/infer  --no-progress-bar --pulse-only  --dump-duplicate-symbols -o infer-out -- javac CheckSimpleDoliImport.java  --doli-capture FileIo.doli

 should trigger an error for m1_bad(), and no error for m2_ok()


 NEXT STEPS:
 - find a different non-generic function from Java libraries (rather than fileio.length()) for which we know the return value
 - consider generics! Most libararies are generic!
